# <-- that code would work, but GH said it was too big and

with urlopen(url) as request:
    data = BytesIO(request.read())

with ZipFile(data) as archive:
    with archive.open(archive.namelist()[0]) as stata:
        ccm = pd.read_stata(stata)

# 3.3.3.1:
# What kinds of questions can I ask? Generally, questions about data fall into two bins:
#     What type of variation occurs within a variable? Ex: Distributions, time trends
#          Outliers, time trends, group differences
#     What type of variation occurs between variables?2 Ex: Scatterplots, plots-by-group
#          Relationships, relatinoships that vary by group

# reasonable steps
#    Explore variation within variables (distributions)
#    Explore covariation between variables
#    Explore how distributions depends on groups
#    Explore how covariation depends on groups

# tips for making a single figure
#     Start with simple graphs, and then build in and layer on "complications" and features.
#     Really compare your code with the syntax in the documentation. Understanding what each parameters does and needs is essential.
#
#         SNS (usually) LIKES LONG DATA FOR MOST PLOTS, PANDAS (usually) LIKES WIDE. (some caveats)
#         I format my data long, and if I want a pandas plot, I use "unstack" to make it wide
#
#     Triple check for typos, unclosed parentheses and the like
#     What chart should I use (with sns examples) and more help on how can I make it
#     The seaborn tutorial page is excellent: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html

# practice time
#    
# Bai Hao (@baihao44) and Connor (@ConnorKressler): Create a histogram of the xrd_a variable
# Carly (@carlydiscolo): Create a boxplot of the capx_a variable
# Andrew (@akz220): Plot the density of the cash_a variable
#
#     distributions (displot and boxplot, .plot())
#         work through parameters
#         tricks: query in data argument
#     covariances (many vars: pairplot, heatmap
#                  two vars in detail: scatterplot, lmplot, jointplot)
#         work through parameters
#         tip: not too many variables for pairplot
#         tricks: in any scatter plot: sample to avoid oversaturation
#     groups - show displot and jointplot with groups
#         Useful parameters: hue, row, style, col
#         Bin / cut continuous vars to create discrete groups
    
# customization
# example: the final heatmap in 3.3.4.3.2
