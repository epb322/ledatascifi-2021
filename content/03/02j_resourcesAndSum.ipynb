    "- Most of the material in this chapter has been geared at an understanding of the core data science tool for data analysis - the _dataframe_ - and how to work with data in it (functions, tasks, manipulating and shaping data)\n",
    "- But we also covered good habits for data analysis, which will pay dividends as we dive into more (and new) datasets in the future\n",
